## AWS 

I leverage AWS S3 buckets for data storage purposes. S3 stands as a remarkably scalable and resilient cloud storage solution offered by Amazon Web Services. This service grants me seamless storage and retrieval capabilities for substantial data volumes, enhanced further by its integrated security measures that bolster the safeguarding of my files. My preference for S3 is rooted in its exceptional scalability, robust durability, and comprehensive security attributes.

## Database

I constructed my database utilizing PostgreSQL, a potent and open-source object-relational database system recognized for its unwavering dependability, resilience, and exceptional performance. I opted for PostgreSQL due to its versatility, offering an efficient tool for adeptly administering and structuring my data.
