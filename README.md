## AWS 

I leverage AWS S3 buckets for data storage purposes. S3 stands as a remarkably scalable and resilient cloud storage solution offered by Amazon Web Services. This service grants me seamless storage and retrieval capabilities for substantial data volumes, enhanced further by its integrated security measures that bolster the safeguarding of my files. My preference for S3 is rooted in its exceptional scalability, robust durability, and comprehensive security attributes.

## Database

I constructed my database utilizing PostgreSQL, a potent and open-source object-relational database system recognized for its unwavering dependability, resilience, and exceptional performance. I opted for PostgreSQL due to its versatility, offering an efficient tool for adeptly administering and structuring my data.

## Bugs

### Fixed bugs
- The issue of increment and decrement functionality not working has been resolved by linking the respective buttons to a jQuery script. This solution ensures that users can now successfully adjust product quantities in the basket using the provided buttons.
- Can't get the payment status. The problem stemmed from incorrect initial settings for both local and deployed endpoints. This issue has been addressed, rectifying the situation and subsequently enabling the successful execution of the payment intent.

## Deployment  
### AWS S3 Bucket Setup  

To set up an AWS S3 bucket:

1. Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon S3 console.
2. Click on the "Create Bucket" button. 
3. Provide a distinct name for the bucket and choose the region in which you wish the bucket to be situated.
4. Customize any extra settings according to the requirements, such as enabling versioning, configuring object-level logging, and applying object tags.
5. Proceed by selecting the "Create" button to establish the bucket.
6. Arrange the suitable permissions for the bucket, including access control lists (ACLs) and bucket policies, to manage data access permissions for authorized users.
7. Upload files to the bucket through the AWS S3 console, the AWS S3 CLI, or the AWS S3 SDK.
8. Retrieve the files via the AWS S3 Console, AWS S3 CLI, or the AWS S3 SDK.

### Heroku 

The website was deployed by following the steps below: 

1. Log in [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login). 
2. Click 'New' and select 'Create new app'
3. Choose a name for the app, region and click on 'Create app'
4. Only 'Deploy' and 'Settings' are relevant from the menu section. Starting with the 'Settings' first.
5. Now Buildpacks need to be added. They install future dependencies that are needed outside of the requirements file. The first is Python and the second is node.js. Python needs to be selected first and then node.js. Save this selection.
6. Now the 'Deploy' section needs to be selected from the menu and connect to Git Hub.
7. Enter the name of the repository we want to connect it with and click 'Connect'
8. The choice appears now to either deploy using automatic deploys or manual deployment, which deploys the current state of the branch.


## Credits

### Code  
- I used the Code Institute's bag and checkout app as a foundation for developing my own checkout and basket applications.
